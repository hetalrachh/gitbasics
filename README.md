#git basics oreilly training

- init: This creates/initializes a git repository in the current directory
        You should do this only once (no nested git repositories)
- status: This gives the current status of the git repository
- add: add the file to the staging area
- commit: commit the file to the repository
          `commit -m` - commits a file with a commit message without opening a vi editor
- log: look at all the commit history that you have been doing
       `log --oneline` - simple one line log view
- diff: view the difference between current state and what git knows
